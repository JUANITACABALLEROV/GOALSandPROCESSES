# Assessing Legal Compliance: A Goal-oriented Process Approach




Legal requirements are dynamic, often seem ambiguous, and rely on legal knowledge for interpretation. Most approaches to assessing legal compliance do not explicitly model the ambiguities and qualitative constraints determining how well compliance is achieved. Linking goals and business process models may offer a complementary view for a deeper understanding of the existing conditions and underlying intentions.  However, existing studies have predominantly focused on manual approaches to align and maintain traceability between goals and processes,  leading to time-consuming tasks and prone to errors.  We propose an integration framework to model legal requirements and assess compliance at design-time, run-time, and post-mortem stages by aligning the evolution of process models and goals models.  Preliminary evaluations using GDPR scenarios suggest the potential of the framework to strengthen traceability between requirements and workflows. First, it explicitly represents the unwritten rules that shape legal reasoning and determine the interpretation of ambiguities and qualitative constraints. Second, it supports communication for all decision-makers involved in compliance decisions.  As a result, it enhances the specification and verification of legal requirements. These initial results confirm the feasibility of a dynamic, integrated framework that bridges the gap between goals and processes, offering evidenceâ€‘based legal compliance.
